# DKP
- GO live
  - only get new entries from last boss, when updating the loot list (prevents overwriting earlier manual changes)
  - test run
    - process if new char is in raid and gets loot
    - process cleaning up data
- code quality
  - unit tests for balance functions
  - constants for string names
- nice to have
  - fix: m+ chars in raid report, test with report vF2C8crAdja1QKhD
    - or show warning and abort if m+ logs in report
